  # The priority is based upon order of creation:
  # first created -> highest priority.

  # Sample of regular route:
  #   match 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'
  # Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action
  match 'refine' => 'main#refine'
  match 'results' => 'main#results'

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  # just remember to delete public/index.html.
  root :to => "main#index"
